      <h1>Want to get in touch?</h1>
      <p>Great! However, please make sure you read these guidelines first in order to ensure seamless communication. The following rules and hints will clarify how I prefer to be contacted and if you stick to them, you're bound to get a fast and meaningful response.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>e‑mail</h2>
      <p>Consider this my preferred means of communication—it's fast, reliable and enables me to produce most meaningful and useful responses. I'm not an e‑mail junkie though—it may take me less than a few minutes to reply to your messages in some cases, but please consider <strong>24 hours</strong> to be my maximum response time. Should you send me a message and get nothing back in 24 hours, make sure to use other means of communication to confirm that I received your e‑mail.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>SMS / Twitter</h2>
      <p>Text messages are another great way of getting in touch with me quickly. In fact, I consider them the fastest method to get <em>any</em> response, yet it'll often be inferior in terms of quality compared to e‑mail. Should you only need a word or two back from me, <strong>SMS</strong> is the way to go.</p>
      <p><a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> is a neat alternative to SMS, and it's free too. Sending me a <strong>direct message</strong> on "Twitter":http://twitter.com is virtually analogous to texting me, so feel free to use whichever you fancy more. You may also <strong>follow</strong> me in order to stay in touch by visiting my <a href="http://twitter.com/matid">Twitter profile</a> and clicking the <strong>follow</strong> button.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Instant Messenger</h2>
      <p>IM is a great way to resolve issues that would otherwise take ages to talk over via e‑mail. So, whenever <em>I happen to be online</em>  and you have something to discuss, don't hesitate to IM me. However, please <strong>do not</strong> IM me when I'm either <em>offline</em> or in <em>do not disturb</em> mode. You'll be better off sending me an e‑mail.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Phone</h2>
      <p>Frankly, this is my least preferred means of communication—it's disruptive, difficult to keep track of and on top of that—highly inefficient. Before you call me, please consider sending an e‑mail or texting me first—the former will yield a profound, meaningful response, whilst the latter will be fast, yet sometimes superficial.</p>

      <h2>Hints</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Make it clear.</h3>
          <p>Make sure your message has a meaningful subject. Avoid words like "hi", "urgent" or leaving the subject blank altogether. If you want the message to pass through my filters and get a snappy response, make sure its subject is a relevant summary of the message itself.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Context is the key.</h3>
          <p>Sending me multiple messages, each containing <em>contextually separate</em> issues is considered superior to dumping everything into one e‑mail. This kind of distinction makes it easier to process—and eventually—respond to your messages.</p>
